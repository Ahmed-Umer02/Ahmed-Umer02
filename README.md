### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about proper GitHub usage, so here are a couple things I plan to work on in the next couple months:
  - Actually commiting things throughout development ğŸ˜„
  - Leaving good messages for the commits ğŸ’¬
  - not doing it all out of the terminal (it's just more time consuming and a bit of a pain but thats how I initially learned git) ğŸ¤“
